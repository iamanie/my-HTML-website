      <h1> <b> "Wanna know me, read this."</b></h1>

      Hello, this is <b> Norhaini Cablo Salipawan</b>, a 21 years young lady from Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat. I was born on August 12, 2002 so I'm basically a Leo.

      <h3> <b> My Hobbies</b></h3>
      <p> My hobbies are simply writing poetries and short stories. I also read poems from the writers who post their works on facebook pages. Some of them are K.RDV of Her Subtle Subs, the page Poetry and Pen, Trudy Jane - Poetry, Prose and Pondering, and many more. I also read some of Pablo Neruda's poem, specifically his love poems.</p>

      <p> Aside from reading and writing, I also like to listen to music and my current favorite artist is Elliot James Reay because he made covers of most of my favorite songs and I find it really good for his voice. I also sing when I'm alone and I'm happy doing that.</p>

      <h3> <b> My Favorites</b></h3>
      <p> I also have favorites on certain things like colors, flowers, food taste, kpop group, artist, and many more.</p>

      <p> Most of my friends thought that black is my favorite color but it isn't. Yes, I know black is a shade, but yeah. Although I like black, my fave is actually purple, all shades of purple.</p>

      <p> Most of my friends also thought that my fave flower is rose or tulip but no, it's sunflower. I remember during pandemic, my sister gave me sunflower seeds and I tried to plant all of it in our yard. Surprisingly, all of them grows to a gorgeous sunflowers.</p>

      <p> I love spicy foods. I'm not really a fan of sweet foods especially candies, except if the candy has a bitter-sweet taste. I'm a fan of the kpop boy group EXO ever since 2014. I'm crazy about them on my baby EXO-L era like I would not eat snacks to save my money so I can go to the internet cafe just to watch their mv songs over and over again. My favorite western artist is Avril Lavigne, I love all of her songs.</p>

      <p> Anothing thing, I have an addiction to coffee and I really love black coffee. I have once tried to make black coffee with my elder sister's mother in law. From harvesting the coffee beans, drying it to the sun, cooking, and grinding it using lusong or mortar and pestle.</p>

      <h3> <b> My Family</b></h3>
      <p> I have a separated parents and I live with my mother, her name is Norma Cablo and my father is Nasser Salipawan. I have 7 siblings and I am the third child, they are Nasrullah, the eldest; Norhata, the second and I am the third; next is Norjanah; Followed by Nasserin, Nestor, and Nasnor. Our 8th sibling and the youngest is Nor-Afirah Hanan, she is also the only one who has a different father, my mother's second husband. Despite of that, our father treat her as his own and I'm really glad of that.</p>

      <p> As you can see, all our names starts with the letter "N" and all the girl's name has the first 3 letters "Nor" which means "light" in Arabic. While the boys' name starts with "Nas" which means "people" in arabic.</p>#a54cc8
